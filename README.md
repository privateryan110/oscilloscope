# oscilloscope
A very simple simulation of an oscilloscope created using p5. 

Fun little project I created to give me a lot more intuitive of an understanding of how oscilloscopes function. 

To Use:

Move the sliders around to change the frequency, amplitute, and phase of the two signals

In the future I would like to add some kind sonic output that matches the signals being shown on the screen.
